I have a lot of games that I love deeply, but not that I would really consider my favorite; I've never thought about it.  If I had to answer decisively here and now, I would say "Celeste" by Matt Makes Games.
Honestly, I'm concerned abouting able to stay on pace in this class, at least at the time of writing.  Not because I'm not invested, but solely because I don't even have my own computer so it's difficult to start and end work as I feel comfortable...
I'm excited about being able to just learn to **make games.**  This is the core skill with which I'm going to make my dreams come true, why wouldn't I be excited?
